In browser Scheme interpreter with semantic visualizations.

As the user enters Scheme expressions in the REPL via the in-browser console, tree pictures are drawn showing the environment structure. Hovering over a node in the tree reveals the bindings present at that node.

This is a Sinatra app. The Scheme interpreter is written in Ruby. The visualizations are made with D3.
